> Logan is a detail minded, serious and professional IT worker. When he started at Shutterstock he was a founding member of my new team, and his attention to detail, intelligence and experienced skills make my job a lot easier. I was able to focus on managing our clients rather then hand hold a new employee since he was 'work ready' right from the start. In addition he's just a great guy to work with, easy going and patient. If given the chance I would hire him again without a second thought. - Jon Napiorkowski (Shutterstock)

> Logan is an amazing person to work with. His calm demeanor is something that keeps everyone working with him at ease, even when the situation gets hectic. I loved working with Logan and hope that I get to work with him again in the future. - Ted Hille (Xerox)
