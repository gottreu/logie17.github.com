Perl is dead, Long live <del>Perl</del> Moe

    "When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather
    than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create."
    --Why the Lucky Stiff

Last weekend I sat and watched [Stevan Little's](https://metacpan.org/author/STEVAN) presentation at [Perl Oasis](http://www.perloasis.info/opw2013/) and how he bemoaned that Perl may be dead. Stevan outlined the sad fact that development of Perl, particularly Perl version 5, is essentially [deadlocked](https://speakerdeck.com/stevan_little/perl-is-not-dead-it-is-a-dead-end) when it comes to new much needed and maybe radical features. As I was watching this I was asking myself these same questions. Has the Perl community become so stale that they are indeed defined by their tastes? And even personally, have I been defined by my preference for Perl than by my abilities as a programmer? Perhaps? I'm actually not sure, I mean I'm still learning new things in Perl. But I have to admit this is a fear of mine as I watch the job postings seeking rock stars and wizards for the latest cool non blocking language or framework. If someone like Stevan, a trusted and admired leader in the Perl community, is saying such sobering things, this is a bit concerning. I have to admit Perl is quirky and that is probably why I love it so much, and sadly it seems most younger programmers don't share these sensibilities. So what was Stevan's answer to this disturbing issue? Fork the code and call it [Moe.](https://github.com/MoeOrganization/moe) In other words, learn and explore.

## Time to learn

So I ask the question, what am I doing to make sure I'm not defined by my tastes? Am I seeking knowledge on a daily basis? In the meantime I'll be reading a hard white paper on [PFOR-DELTA](http://wiki.apache.org/lucy/LucyBookClub), exploring [Pegex](https://metacpan.org/module/INGY/Pegex-0.21/lib/Pegex.pod), and maybe taking a crack at learning [Scala.](http://www.scala-lang.org/) So I'll watch Moe and maybe I'll commit something, and hopefully in the process learn and appreciate new and interesting things. So keep pushing those bits to [Github](https://github.com/logie17) and in the process Perl will win a few new young hearts again.
