Back in 2007, [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com), posted a blog entry title [Why Can't Programmers..Program?](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html). In this posting was a diatribe on claimed skill sets of programmer applicants and their actual ability to program "their way out of a paper bag". Quoting from various other bloggers it seems at the program [FizzBuzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FizzBuzz) is a common screening tool by interviewers to separate the wheat from the chaff.  He quotes [Dan Kegal](http://www.kegel.com/) saying "you're already ahead of the pack" if you can demonstrate some proficiency solving "real problems" with recursion.

So I thought I would give a go at creating some basic FizzBuzz examples in a handful of the languages that I'm familiar with. These are just basic examples, nothing very fancy but they demonstrate an understanding of the problem and they use recursion.

*Perl*

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;


    sub fizz_buzz
    {
        my $count = shift;
        return if $count == 0;
        fizz_buzz($count-1);
        print "$count-Fizz\n" if $count % 3 == 0;
        print "$count-Buzz\n" if $count % 5 == 0;
        print "$count-FizzBuzz\n" if $count % 5 == 0 && $count % 3 == 0;
    }

    fizz_buzz(100);

*C++*

    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    void fizzbuzz(int);

    int main()
    {
        fizzbuzz(100);
    }

    void fizzbuzz(int count)
    {
        if (count == 0)
            return;
        fizzbuzz(count-1);
        if (count % 3 == 0 )
            cout << count << "-Fizz" << endl;
        if (count % 5 == 0 )
            cout << count << "-Buzz" << endl;
        if (count % 3 == 0 && count % 5 == 0 )
            cout << count << "-FizzBuzz" << endl;
    }

*Bash*

    #! /bin/bash

    function fizzbuzz
    {
        count=1

        while [ $count -le 100 ]
        do
            let mod3=$count%3
            let mod5=$count%5
            if [ [ $mod3 -eq 0 ]]; then
                echo "$count - Fizz";
            fi
            if [ $mod5 -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "$count - Buzz";
            fi
            if [[ $mod3 -eq 0 && $mod5 -eq 0 ]]; then
                echo "$count - FizzBuzz";
            fi
            let "count+=1";
        done
    }

    fizzbuzz

*Ruby - Both recursive and rubyish ways*

    #! /usr/bin/ruby

    def fizzbuzz(count)
        return if count == 0;
        fizzbuzz(count-1);
        print "#{count} -Fizz\n" if count % 3 == 0;
        print "#{count} -Buzz\n" if count % 5 == 0;
        print "#{count} -FizzBuzz\n" if count % 5 == 0 && count % 3 == 0;
    end

    fizzbuzz(100)

    (1..100).each do|count|
        print "#{count} -Fizz\n" if count % 3 == 0;
        print "#{count} -Buzz\n" if count % 5 == 0;
        print "#{count} -FizzBuzz\n" if count % 5 == 0 && count % 3 == 0;
    end
